> *we are all tired of chromium and firefox based browsers aren't we? If you use this light boi, your RAM will thank you <3* - me

AntiChromium(formerly BlahBlah Broswer) is a lightweight, heavily customisable desktop browser built with **Python + PyQt6 + QtWebEngine**. It was born out of frustration with Chromium's monopoly on browser aesthetics and a desire to actually *own* your browser experience — down to every color and font. Make it **your** broswer.

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Theming System
- **8 built-in themes**
    - B L A K(darker than my soul at 3am)
    - W H I T(brighter than discord light mode)
    - Dracula(perfect for productivity)
    - Win7 Nostalgia(ah trows me to the good days)
    - Liquid Glass(apple increasingly knocking on my door harder and harder)
    - Molten Chrome(Nothing is more molten than my RAM when Chrome gulps it down its mouth)
    - Punk(no one understands me ahh)
    - GradientZ(OOOooOOh GRADIENTS OOOH)
    - Terminal(sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve-root. run this to unlock true digital freedom - wipe everything :D)
    - RandomME(generates a compleatly new theme every time its selected)
- **Full theme editor** — pick every single color with a visual color picker, live preview before saving
- **Import / Export** themes as JSON — share your themes with others or back them up so you can share them :O.
- **User themes** persist between sessions in `~/.blahblah_browser/themes/`

### 🗂 Tab Management
- **Horizontal tabs** (classic) or **Vertical tabs** — switchable at any time from settings
- Tab **fade-in animation** on open
- Right-click to close tabs in vertical mode
- Keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl+T` new tab, `Ctrl+W` close tab

### 🔍 Navigation
- Smart URL bar — detects URLs vs search queries automatically
- Animated **glow effect** on the URL bar when focused (color matches your active theme) waah so cool so glow!
- Animated **progress bar** during page load so NICEEE!
- Find in page (`Ctrl+F`) with previous/next navigation

### 📐 Other
- **Zoom controls** (`Ctrl+` / `Ctrl-` / `Ctrl+0`) with live % display in settings
- **Smooth scroll** injection via JavaScript makes the page scroll smoother than butter.
- **JavaScript toggle** — disable JS globally across all tabs. why would you do that tho.
- **Bookmark sidebar** — slides in/out, double-click to navigate, add new bookmarks from settings. who uses bookmarks in the big 26 twin...
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for everything. yeah.
- `faulthandler` enabled — crashes print a real traceback instead of silently dying and letting you lose your mindstream of consciousness tabs. no more "Aw, Snap!" nonsense. t r a n s p a r e n c y    i s    k e y.

## 🎨 Creating a Custom Theme

1. Open **Settings (⚙)** → click **✏ Edit** to edit the current theme, or **＋ New** to start fresh
2. Pick colors for every UI element using the color pickers
3. Hit **👁 Preview** to see it applied live without saving
4. Hit **💾 Save** to store it permanently — it will appear in the theme dropdown
5. Use **📤 Export JSON** to save the file anywhere to share it

### Theme JSON format

```json
{
  "name": "My Theme",
  "win_bg": "#0f0f0f",
  "bg": "#0f0f0f",
  "surface": "#1a1a1a",
